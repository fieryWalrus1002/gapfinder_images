# Next steps:

1. roi image width should be standardized to about 60 pixels

- run 7b to re-extract, and set to the appropriate output

2. proceed with 8. don't slice, instead just use the whole image in the histogram
3. the peak widths should be calculated at about 50% of the peak height

- this is a good way to standardize the width of the peaks, and it's a good way to compare the peaks to each other

Done re-extacting. Now I will proceed with 8.
