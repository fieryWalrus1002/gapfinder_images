# overview:
# We underestimated how large of a region we needed to extract from the original image to rotate and get the ROI.
# We need to use what we have to extract a larger region from the original image, rotate the region, and save it, so we can then run our roi extraction on the rotated image.
# At this point, we have a list of centroids, we have a list of rotation angles. These are located in 
# AFter rotating, we had some artifacts because the image that we rotated was a sub-image of the original image.
# If we want an ROI, rotated from the original image, we need to extract a larger region from the original image than we need.

# Step 0:
# revised! We were wrong, we can't load the roi metadata directly. It is incomplete. We need to go back a step and combine two files. 
# We need to load the rotated_images\rotation_angles.txt file and strip_images\strip_metadata.csv instead and combine them.
# strip_metadata.csv has the following columns:
# strip,filename,box_size,x,y
# 0,./raw_images/2022-1-10_Wild Type_500uE 1 hour_1_13_29k.png,200,596,1664
# and then we have the rotation_angles.txt file with the following format:
# strip_0.png: 0.0
# strip_1.png: 0.0
# So you can see how we need a function to load these files, then a function to combine them and save them as roi_metadata.csv. Then we can load roi_metadata.csv and continue with the rest of the script.
