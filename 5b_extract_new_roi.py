# overview:
# We underestimated how large of a region we needed to extract from the original image to rotate and get the ROI.
# We need to use what we have to extract a larger region from the original image, rotate the region, and save it, so we can then run our roi extraction on the rotated image.
# At this point, we have a list of centroids, we have a list of rotation angles. These are located in 
# AFter rotating, we had some artifacts because the image that we rotated was a sub-image of the original image.
# If we want an ROI, rotated from the original image, we need to extract a larger region from the original image than we need.

# Step 1, load the ROI metadata.
# Here are the headers for the ./roi_metadata.csv file:
# strip,filename,box_size,x,y,strip_filename,rotation_angle,x1,y1,x2,y2
# 'strip': the strip number, a unique identifier for the strip
# 'filename': the original image filename, that we will work from
# 'box_size':  the size of the box that we will extract. This is the width and heighth of the box, centered around the x,y coordinates
# 'x', 'y': indicates the centroid of the box
# 'strip_filename': indicates the strip filename
# 'rotation_angle': indicates the rotation angle of the strip
# 'x1','y1','x2','y2': The upper left and lower right coordinates of the box in the rotated strip image. Cannot be used as is, because they are relative to the original rotated image size.


# Step 2, iterate through each row in the ROI metadata and perform our operations as listed below:
# - Load the original image
# - Extract a larger padded box (original box + a padding parameter)
# - Rotate the padded subimage
# - Save the rotated image in the ./rotated_images folder
# - Save the new ROI metadata in the ./ folder as a csv file, ./roi_metadata_padded.csv. This will have the same columns as the original metadata, but with the x1, y1, x2, y2 columns updated to reflect the new coordinates in the rotated image.
