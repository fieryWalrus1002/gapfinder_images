# notes:
- don't try to add the padding, just use the edge of the membrane as Vaclav did in his selection
- stick with gapfinder, move that forward first
- process the images according to the metadata that Vaclav provided
- then I can run it through my processing, and we can discuss the results
  
  ## grana segmentation work
  - use the unet, but we need to get some immunogold images to train it
  - Helmut will email Vaclav about the data
  - Magnus will label and train the existing unet with the new data, 
  - see how it works and share
